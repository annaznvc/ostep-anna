1. Before doing any translations, let’s use the simulator to study how
linear page tables change size given different parameters. Compute
the size of linear page tables as different parameters change. Some
suggested inputs are below; by using the -v flag, you can see
how many page-table entries are filled. First, to understand how
linear page table size changes as the address space grows, run with
these flags:
-P 1k -a 1m -p 512m -v -n 0
-P 1k -a 2m -p 512m -v -n 0
-P 1k -a 4m -p 512m -v -n 0
Then, to understand how linear page table size changes as page size
grows:
-P 1k -a 1m -p 512m -v -n 0
-P 2k -a 1m -p 512m -v -n 0
-P 4k -a 1m -p 512m -v -n 0
Before running any of these, try to think about the expected trends.
